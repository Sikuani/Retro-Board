# Project Name: Retro Board

## Purpose of the Project

The Retro Board is a web application designed to facilitate retrospectives for teams or individuals. The application allows users to organize their thoughts and reflections into three categories: "Went Well," "To Improve," and "Action Items." The Retro Board helps users to identify what went well, areas that need improvement, and action items or tasks to address.

## Installation and Setup

To use the Retro Board, follow these steps:

just access the repository page where the application is available. The repository is:
https://sikuani.github.io/

## Usage Instructions

- The Retro Board will display three categories: "Went Well," "To Improve," and "Action Items," in that order. These categories are clearly organized to help users identify the UI elements belonging to each category.

- To add a new retrospective item to any category, click on the "Add" button or the respective UI element associated with that category. This will create a new item or task where you can type your reflections.

- Inside each retrospective item, you can type text to store your reflections. The text is stored in state, and it can only be modified while you are typing inside the item.

- To delete a retrospective item, click on the "Delete" button or the delete icon associated with that item. The item or task will be removed from both the state and the application.

- To move a retrospective item or task to a different category, click on the left or right arrow button associated with the item. If there is no category to the left, clicking the left arrow will move the item to the rightmost category, and vice versa. The visual structure and appearance of the item will remain the same after moving to a different category, except for color.

- The application has a button that allows you to change the state of the display to see it in light mode (sun icon), which is predetermined, and dark mode (moon icon).
